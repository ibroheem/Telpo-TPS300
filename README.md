# Telpo-TPS300

Contains Useful code examples to get a programmer started with the TPS300 series.  
**Note**: There is a TPS300 and a TPS300A. TPS300A's programming environment is Linux, flashing is on Windows - **wierd?!**. The TPS300 programming and flashing environment is on Windows.

Contents:
1. Compilation instruction for C++. C is said to be supported by default. I strongly **defer**  with those guys.
2. Compilation instructions for third party Libraries. If you want to use third party libraries in your development
3. Code examples with Code::Blocks project files. Now is a good time to download and Learn Code::Blocks

Some dependencies used in extending capabilities, e.g C++11 nullptr support from ETL
1. ArduinoJson
2. ETL (Embedded Template Library)
